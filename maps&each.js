// I apologize for the confusion. You're right; I should have used `.map` in my JavaScript code. Let me clarify the difference between `forEach` and `map` and when to use each:

// 1. `forEach`:
//    - `forEach` is a method available for arrays in JavaScript.
//    - It iterates over each item in the array and allows you to perform an operation or execute a function for each item.
//    - It does not create a new array; it simply applies a function to each element and does not return any value.
//    - It is typically used when you want to perform a side effect for each item in the array, such as logging, updating values, or performing other operations that don't require generating a new array.

// Example:

// ```javascript
// const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
// numbers.forEach(number => console.log(number * 2));
// ```

// 2. `map`:
//    - `map` is also a method available for arrays in JavaScript.
//    - It iterates over each item in the array and allows you to apply a function to each item, returning a new array with the results.
//    - It creates a new array by applying the function to each element in the original array, and it returns that new array.
//    - It is typically used when you want to transform the elements of an array into a new array based on some operation.

// Example:

// ```javascript
// const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
// const doubledNumbers = numbers.map(number => number * 2);
// console.log(doubledNumbers); // [2, 4, 6, 8]
// ```

// In your case, if you want to extract details from the transactions and create a new array or perform some transformation on each transaction, `map` would be the appropriate choice. If you only need to perform some action or operation for each transaction without creating a new array, `forEach` can be used.

// I apologize for the oversight in my previous code. Thank you for pointing it out, and I appreciate your understanding.
